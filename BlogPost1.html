                            <br>

                    <p>My first blog post. I'm happy that I am willing to document this journey. This journey will be a test of discipline and intitative. I'm going to go on a quest to be an independent self-learner.</p>

                    <p>Okay, maybe not completely independent. I am getting some help from all the authors of the content that I will be consuming. That sounds way less cool but is a lot more accurate. (Sidenote: generally no one ever gets anywhere without the help of others.) The area that I am interested in is computer programming. I am not as concerned with the details of the journey quite yet. Rather, I am simply glad that I have taken the intitiative to move forward in my life.</p>


                    <p>Well first, here's a little about the backstory to this new quest. I am a graduate from Metropolitan State University of Denver. I received a Bachelor's in Journalism with an emphasis in Public Relations. My minor was marketing. I guess, the purpose was to get a little bit of a general overview within the marketing domain and then hone in on a particular tool within the broad industry; Public Relations.</p>

                    <blockquote><p>I changed my mind.</p></blockquote>

                    <p>5 years of school flew by and all of a sudden I found myself with a degree in something that I did not care about. But I'm all about practicality so I figured, why not give it a chance? So, the summer after graduation, I interviewed with a few different companies and some of the interviews went really well. However, I didn't really find my self being eager to take on the roles that were required of me. Secondly, both marketing and PR are incredibly saturated industries with a moderate demand for specialists. Finally, the chemistry was never really there between my personality type and those industries.</p>

                    <p>So for a while I backed off trying to become a professional marketer/pr specialist and decided to keep working small time jobs until I figured out what it is that I wanted to do.</p>

                    <p>And here we are now in this blog entry, a year and a half later. I'm writing down my plan for learning a whole new discipline and possibly a new career path. Programming seems to be right up the alley of what I'm looking for. I have all the reason in the world to pursue it. I've always been keen to troubleshooting problems, especially in a computer. I'm generally more analytical and love to understand logic behind things. The market is in high demand. More particularly I've always had an eye for aesthetics and design. Perfect. Web Dev might be a great entry points  </p>

                    <p>Let's see where it takes me.</p>
