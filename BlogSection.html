                <h2>My First Programming Language: Why Javascript Has Captured My Attention</h2>
                <h6>Posted on 2/05/2019</h6>

                <p><strong class="firstletter ">J</strong>avascript is going to be the language that I want to hone in on. After doing a few lessons in Khan Academy, I'm hooked. Although I do want to become an expert at Python some day, I'm loving the experience
                    as learning Javascript as my first language.</p>
                <p class="tab ">Why choose JavaScript? Let's keep it short and give you 3 reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><em>It Makes Learning Programming Fun</em></li>
                        <p> Let's be honest; programming isn't fun when you're first starting. You're getting used to a whole different way of thinking. Simple ideas, can be executed in a variety of ways. It can also takes quite a bit of typing to create
                            even the smallest programs. But it's really worth getting over the tedious work. Especially if you're learning Javascript in a processing environment because those small programs are so visual. IN general, Javascript is responsible for most of the interactive visual elements we see on a web
                            page so it is by its nature the most promising with respect to seeing the fruits of your labor. </p>
                        <li><em>It's a Good Gateway Language</em></li>
                        <p>What I've learned so far from people within the industry is that it's important that a programmer make himself versatile. One can always make a variety of programs or work on a variety of projects. But the most sure-fire-way to
                            do that is to know a variety of languages.</p>
                        <p> <em class="tab ">What does that have to do with Java?.</em> </p>
                        <p>Well, it definitely helps to first learn a language that is similar to most existing languages. It has the object-oriented benefits of lower level language like Java and the benefits of higher-level language commands that are a
                            lot more simple. So whether your direction is working with another scripting language Python or willing get down and dirty with the details of an operating system, Javascript is a good starting language for you.</p>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>2nd <del>Time</del> Degree is a Charm?</h2>
                    <h6>Posted on 12/15/2018</h6>

                    <p><strong class="firstletter ">M</strong>y first blog post. I'm happy that I am willing to document this journey. <strong class="questions "> <em>"What journey? "</em></strong>, you may ask. Well, I am going on a quest to be a completely independent
                        self-learner. Okay, maybe not completely. I am getting some help from all the authors of the content that I will be consuming on the internet. Okay, that sounds way less cool but a lot more accurate. The area that I am interested in
                        is computer science. I am not as concerned with the details of the journey I intend to embark on quite yet. Rather, I am simply glad that I have taken the intitiative to move forward in my life. </p>
                    <p class="tab "> Well first, here's a little about the backstory to this new quest.</p>
                    <p>I am a graduate from Metropolitan State University of Denver. I received a Bachelor's in Journalism with an emphasis in Public Relations. My minor was marketing. I guess, the purpose was to get a little bit of a general overview within
                        the marketing discipline and then hone in on a particular tool wihtin the broad industry; Public Relations. </p>
                    <p class="tab "> I change my mind.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>5 years blew by and all of a sudden I found myself with a degree in something that I do NOT care about. But I'm all about practicality so I figure, why not give it a chance. I interviewed with a few different companies and some of the
                        interviews went really well. However, I wasn't a good fit for the most part. </p>
