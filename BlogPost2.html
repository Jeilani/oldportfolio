                            <p>
                            Javascript is going to be the language that I want to hone in on. After doing a few lessons in Khan Academy, I'm hooked. Although I do want to become an expert at Python some day, I'm loving the experience as learning Javascript as my first language.</p>

                            <p></p>Why choose JavaScript? Let's keep it super short and give you two reasons.</p>

                            <p> It Makes Learning Programming Fun</p>
                            <p> Let's be honest, programming isn't fun when you're first starting. You're getting used to a whole different way of thinking. Simple ideas, can be executed in a variety of ways. It can also takes quite a bit of typing to create even the smallest programs. But it's really worth getting over the tedious work. Especially if you're learning Javascript in a web environment and more specifically, in a processing environment because those small programs are so visual. IN general, Javascript is responsible for most of the interactive visual elements we see on a web page so it is by its nature the most promising with respect to seeing the fruits of your labor. But Processing has allowed me to take it to a higher level by seeing highly visual elements in a canvas.</p>

                            <p>It's a Good Gateway Language</p>

                            <p>What I've learned so far from people within the industry is that it's important that a programmer make himself versatile. One can always make a variety of programs or work on a variety of projects. But the most sure-fire-way to do that is to know a variety of languages.</p>

                            <p>What does that have to do with JavaScript?</p>

                            <p>Well, it definitely helps to first learn a language that is similar to most existing languages. It has the object-oriented benefits of lower level language like Java and the benefits of higher-level language commands that are a lot more simple. So whether your direction is working with another scripting language Python or willing get down and dirty with the details of an operating system, Javascript is a good starting language for you.</p>
