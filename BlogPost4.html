                            <h6 class=""><em>Posted on June 8, 2019</em></h6>
                            <br>
                            <p>"Okay, what if I just sit down and try to dedicate 30 minutes and whatever happens happens."</p>
                            <p>This a thought that ran through my mind in one of my early days of learning to become a programmer. One of those days that every bit of my body was resisting the acts of sitting still and coding.</p>
                            <p>This occured to me after a bit of internal back-and-forth between my lazy side and my determined side. But after that perfect idea popped up, I managed to sit down and try to focus afterall.  </p>
                            <p>It was reasonable because it was an achieavable feat. At the time, my daily goal was to do four hours of coding a day and I would almost never accomplish it. Some days I wouldn't even do a single minute. The problem was how much of a climb that goal of four ours seemed in my head.</p>
                            <p> So I did a quick self-psychoanalysis and realized why the feat seemed so terrible.</p>
                                <p><strong>Framing</strong></p>
                            <p>There are many things that I can do for several hours that seem to make time ephemeral. I continued on this idea. Obviously, it's because I enjoy those things. But I realized I enjoy coding too. So it logically follows that learning how to program can become one of those things that make time fly, if I just look at it in the right way.</p>
                            <p>Then the thought in the beginning of this blog entry. Okay how about I forget this idea of 4 hours but rather just try to sit down for 30 minutes a day and whatever happens happens. Throw away this goal that makes the act so scary and just go with something simple and see where that takes me.</p>
                            <p>Things haven't been peaches and cream since but it's certainly a useful framing tool that has turned a lot of potentially wasted days into productive days.</p>
